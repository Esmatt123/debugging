  <h1>Which is better, ice cream or cake?</h1>
  <h2>Ice cream is obviously better than cake.</h2>
  <p>Ice cream is definitely better than cake! I think ice cream is better because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's cold and refreshing</li>
    <li>It comes in a bunch of great flavors</li>
    <li>It doesn't get stale</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also, ice cream is great because:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You can buy it easily from any store</li>
    <li>You can put toppings on it</li>
  </ol>
